           and accessible to a diverse group of people, including the disabled. 
          <br>On the other hand, the alarm button has a red circle around it as if
           the button was activated like the floor buttons, which could confuse the user.</p>

            <br>&#10004; Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
            <br>&#10004; Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?
            <br>&#10004; How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?
            <br>&#10004; How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
            <br>&#10004; What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
            <br>&#10004; Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.

        <h1 style="font-size:3vw" class="w3-text-">Common Elevator Use</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.5vw"> The most common use of an elevator is to move
           up and down from floor to floor.
          Another rarer use of an elevator is to move material and other goods 
          inside mines and manufacturing plants. 
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size:3vw" class="w3-text-">Common Sequence of Actions</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.5vw"> The common sequence of actions in using an elevator is
          <ol>
            <li>The user presses the up or down arrow and waits for the door to open.</li>
            <li>Once the door opens, the user will press the number corresponding to the floor level they are going to.</li>
            <li>Once the elevator is on the correct floor level, the door will open, and the user will walk out. </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size:3vw" class="w3-text-">How to make elevator work</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.5vw"> The elevator panel's design is similar to how it will work.
           As the buttons are aligned vertically, starting from 1 on the bottom, the user will 
           quickly understand how to use the panel. Furthermore, the alignment of the buttons 
           and design of the panel reassures the users they are using it properly.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size:3vw" class="w3-text-">Elevator feedback</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.5vw"> The elevator provides feedback couple of ways,
           such as with the red ring that lights up when you press a button. 
           The elevator also makes loud beeps as it passes a floor.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size:3vw" class="w3-text-">Common Mistakes Made with Current Design</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.5vw"> Some common mistakes you could make with this design would
           be accidentally pressing another button. Some users made the mistake of thinking
            floors 2,3 and 4 required keys to access that level each time.
        </p>
